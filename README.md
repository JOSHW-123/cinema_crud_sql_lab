This repository contains the solution for a 
coding bootcamp lab exercise which focuses on 
demonstrating the use of CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations in SQL.

The purpose of this lab is to help learners understand and apply the basic SQL operations on a database, as well as 
to reinforce their understanding of relational databases and the importance of normalization in database design.

The solution includes the SQL code for creating tables, inserting data, querying data, updating data, and deleting data, 
as well as a brief explanation of each operation.

This repository can be used as a reference for learners who are just starting out with SQL and want to practice their skills, 
or as a starting point for more complex projects.
